# Phase 3.1: Minimal FFI stub - full Arrow integration deferred until dependency stabilization
# Currently building with Rust 1.75.x. When Rust is upgraded to 1.93+ in build environment,
# uncomment arrow/lance dependencies below and update src/lib.rs to use them.
# See PAIMON_LANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 3.1+ for full implementation.

# Deferred until dependency conflict resolution:
# arrow = { version = "54", features = ["ffi"] }
# lance = "0.19"
# tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread"] }
